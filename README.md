to run: npm start


This is a project built to practice a React/Typescript techstack, with a focus on the UI. (The sound creation part is left for a later exercise).

("Start audio context" button is for debugging/development. Would not need to be there in final version.)

Some improvements I or another developer could make in the future: I could do a refactor to practice cleaner code when I have time. I also could clean up the appearance of these buttons: 'add noise editor' button (make the size match the existing noise editors), delete button (not line break after the icon), and the start/stop button (not breaking to two lines when screen is medium).
