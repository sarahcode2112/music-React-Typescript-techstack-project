This is a project built to practice the Ledgy techstack, with a focus on the UI. (The noise sound creation does not actually work).

If it fits the trainee study plan/schedule: I could do a refactor to practice cleaner code when I have time. I also could clean up the appearance of these buttons: 'add noise editor' button (make the size match the existing noise editors), delete button (not line break after the icon), and the start/stop button (not breaking to two lines when screen is medium).

("Start audio context" button is for debugging/development. Would not need to be there in final version.)
